# ComputerCraft-Legacy
(currently) An experimental, possibly crappy reverse engineering of ComputerCraft 1.2 for Legacy Minecraft.
Currently incomplete.


## Current Status
Computers are nearly complete but do not properly interact with redstone. For some bizzare reason, they can provide power to redpower alloy wires, but still cannot read from them.

Disk drive does not work and will crash the game if you put anything in it, especially anything that isn't a disk.

Disks are indeterminate, without a disk drive to use them.

Computer recipe changed from glass pane to glass block.

Multiplayer does not work yet, and a lot of multiplayer code was stripped out for simplicity but will be re-added back
